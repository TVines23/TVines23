# About Me 
My name is Tyree Vines, And I am a Graduate of the University of South Alabama class of 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in Interdisiplinary Studies. I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a passion for protecting systems and networks, and I value the importance of maintaining security in our digital world. Currently, I am in the process of obtaining my CompTIA Security + certificate through Coursera's certificate program, which I believe will equip me with the skills necessary to contribute effectively to an organization's security goals. 
## Why Cybersecurity?
With the increasing reliance on digital systems, I am deeply motivated to contribute to securing critical infrastructure and preventing cyber threats. I thrive on problem-solving, and staying up to date with evolving technologies, and collaborating to find innovative solutions to security challenges.
## My Goals
1. Develop technical expertise in cybersecurity tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Python scripting.
2. Earn industry-recognized certifications such as CompTIA Security+ and the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.
3. Transition into a professional cybersecurity role where I can contribute to protecting systems and data.

This portfolio will document my journey, from learning the basics to solving real-world challenges. I look forward to adding certifications, projects, and more skills as I continue growing in the field.
Feel free to connect with me!
